This project aims to make managing sheet music for bands easier. 

The intended workflows are as follows:

1. As a librarian, I want to upload a PDF of the entire score, which I want seperated into pages for each instrument/player (trumpet 2/trumpet 3 seperate)
2. As a librarian, I want to share the drive links for sections of musics to the players provided in a spreadsheet
3. As a player, I want to submit a google drive folder link and create 1 pdf with all of the relevent music for printing
